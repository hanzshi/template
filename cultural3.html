			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>No matter PVE or PVP, in World of Warcraft, teamwork is the most important. Everyone has his own job and have to be responsible for that, in order to win the battle. After the battle, the player will have changes to receive items from the monster. And stronger monster will drop stronger items and can make the character stronger and have the ability to against higher level monster and quests. In World of Warcraft, everyone in the game can choose his own talent, either a Healer, DPS, or a Tank. Each talent refers to different responsibility to a team. As a Healer, the main task for them is to make sure everyone stay alive and keep a good condition to against the boss. They will need to use their heal skills to help every wounded player and use dispel skill to dispel the bad buff on every teammates. For a good healer, control the mana (the recourse for player to release silks) is really important. Since in a raid, the number of healers are limited, so each healer plays an important role in the team. They need to keep healing the team, so it is easy to out of mana. Healer need to control the mana, and use it for the urgent time, like when the boss release huge area damage silks. For a DPS, the main thing for them is to do damage to the boss. So the DPS have to know a series of technique to maximum their damage to the boss. That need practice and also need careful to every details. While the DPS doing the damage to the boss, they also should be able to avoid the boss’s skill as much as possible to reduce the pressure of the healers. At certain time DPS should use their own protected skill to avoid damage from a strong attack. DPS have the most amount in a raid team because more damage to the boss the boss will die quickly. So DPS is an indispensable part of a team. The last talent is the Tank, which is the core of a team. The job of Tank is to get all enemies’ enmity to protect other team members. Tank need to keep using skill to protect or reduce damage for themselves. In a 25 raid team there are usually only two tanks, their need to exchange to taunt the boss in order to remove the bad buff the boss add on them. Tank have to pull boss well and the DPS can do damage to the boss, and tank need to observe the battlefront to pull the boss to the safety place, away from those area will continues do damage to players.  So the DPS and healer can focus on their jobs. Overall, tank is just like the leader of the team, they will start the fight and lead the team move or attack the correct target. Each profession plays different role in a raid team but all of them is indispensable.</p>
