		<h1>Course Retrospective Project</h1>
		<p>　　　In 2014 Spring Semester, the WRA course I attended is WRA 110 Science and Technology, taught by Dr. Christie Daniel. WRA 110 is the study and practice of varieties of invention, arrangement, revision, style and delivery to help students make successful transitions to writing, reading and researching in higher education. In order to have a better skill of successful life or career, good writing, reading and researching abilities is the essential. This course is where students can learn those necessary abilities and get the knowledge to using them in life. In this course I have experienced lots of interesting projects this semester, including Lived Experienced Project, Cultural Analysis Proposal, Formal Research Project, Multimedia Remix Project, Blogs and this one is working on Course Retrospective Project. All of these are good experience for me, and the way I was doing these is also the way I am building myself.</p>
		<p>　　　The first project is the Lived Experiences Project, for this project it requires us to identify an academic or professional career track for myself and also requires to describe the technology led me to this chosen field and the experiences with technology that relate to my chosen field. Before this Project, I have no ideal about what I am going to do for my life career and have no ideal about how the daily technology affected me. So, I picked my major, which is Applied Engineering Science as my field to do this project. At that time I was still can not confirm my major, still thinking about change my major. But after I did a lot of research about Applied Engineering Science, I have confirmed this is what I want to learn and this is what I want to be. I learned a lot about the major and I have a new acknowledge of my major. Also the project requires 1200 words length. This is kind of long for me, I have never wrote a paper as long as this one in english. So, this is a challenge for me. But because my writing skill is limited I did not do well on the first project, only got a 79%. However, complete this challenge is a good start for me and also let me understand that do research can bring me lots of information and clear defined my goal. After this project is finished, students are required to put their paper work on website by using github. I have totally no ideal about website making and using of github. Dr. Daniels leaded us to the github page and gave us the basic elements of our web portfolio. Under the instruction of Dr. Daniels I finally make my github page worked, thank you!</p>
		<p>　　　The Second Project is the Cultural Analysis Proposal. To do this project students will select an artifact of popular culture and depicts social issue. I was playing World of Warcraft when this project came. So I picked World of Warcraft as my popular culture. I love World of Warcraft so I have a lot of experience of this game and also from this game I can see reflected lots of social issues. After experiencing the first project I have the sense to write the paper. Basic follow the guideline provided as my structure of my paper, using personal thinking and critical analysis the social issues. I thought a lot about the game reflects to the Society and this bring me to a new height of the game. When the next time I play the game, I felt like not only playing a game. However, this project requires MLA or APA format and also 1800-2100 words length. Which is a new challenge for me. I did research on MLA format and carefully arrange my words in paper. Finally, I finished this paper and get a 87%, which is good improve for me.</p>
		<p>　　　The third project is the Formal Research Project. This project requires students analysis scholarly article, trade publication, interview a person in the chosen discipline. All of this are brand new to me. In order to finish this project I have learned lots of useful skills from the class. Such as how to searching on the online library, how to well analysis an article and how to search for key words. These skills learned from this course will make student be able to do academic research and analysis by themselves. Also, the interview this project required force me to interview other the first time. Afterwards, I felt to interview another person is not that hard, the key is the first step. The requirement of length is becoming longer and longer, this project needs to have 2700 words. I could believe that I have done such long paper after I finished this project. This also taught me that there is no impossible unless not do it. Good thing is that I received 85% for my project, I am satisfied with it.</p>
		<p>　　　The fourth project is also the one we finished recently, the Multimedia Remix Project. This project gives students the opportunity to revise and trans-mediate one of earlier projects, strengthening the original purpose of the piece into an alternative form of a short documentary. This is a group project, also is the one I like the most. This project is not just about testing student’s writing skills but also testing student’s comprehensive skills. It requires us critical analysis the social issues we picked from one of our teammate’s previous project. Our Project is about the Science and Technology. The documentary shows this in action by exploring the effects of technology on the current generation. We want people understand the overload of technology is bringing a really bad effects to current generation. In order to finish this project our group meet up couple times and discussed the structure of the documentary. Also we took the same questions interview to different people we know, to make the documentary more convictive. The best part of this project is about the team work. Since this is a group project, all four of us are able to work together and come up ideas and find resources for the project. The communication between the team members are important, it provides the project more trustable. Also there was some problems while we try to put the project on the github page. But one of teammate figure out the problem and help others fixed the problems which brings a lot of convince. From this project, I have learned how to work with others and speak out my personal opinions and also learned to help other will make the things more convince. This project is not just a Remix Project but also a good integral activity.</p>
		<p>　　　During the class, there are also some in-class activities in this course. Writing a Blog is one of them. We have wrote three blogs so far in this course, each time we watch a short video clip, maybe a story, a cartoon or an advertisement. Then follow the questions given write the opinions students have to make as a blog entry. This is a great activity to practice students fast thinking and analysis’ ability, and can find the students’ thinking model by the answer student given. Also the portfolio I created for all my project in this class will be a valuable souvenir for this course. When I look back the portfolio, I may be able to find the good memory of this period and tell myself did a good job!</p>
		<p>      The fifth project is this one I am working on. This project ask student to reread the reports and projects that have created this semester, to meet the major goals. For this project, I just summary all the work I have done in this course and what I have learned from those projects. In my view, I have learned lots of useful skills and experiences for my later career from this course. Such as use writing for purposes of reflection, action, and participation in academic inquiry. Engage in reading for the purposes of reflection, critical analysis, decision making, and inquiry. Read in ways that improve writing, especially by demonstrating an ability to analyze invention, arrangement and revision strategies at work in a variety of texts. Exercise a flexible repertoire of invention, arrangement, and revision strategies. Demonstrate an understanding of research as epistemic and recursive processes that arise from and respond back to various communities. All of these I have learned or experienced could be a boost for my future life.</p>
		<p>      This course is a challenge for me, whose first language is not english. As soon as I finished projects one by one, the more reading, writing, analysis skills I gathered from this course. Still, it is hard for me to write a 3000 words length paper. But the writing logic and researching skills I had now, is enough for me to face these challenge. The more challenge I faced the more improvement I will have. Generally, the ability I received from this class is valuable. I feel good to take this course and if let me retake this course one more again, I will have confidence to ace every project.  </p>
