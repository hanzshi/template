		<p>　　  　Everyone in this world is the lucky man, cause they have the chance to see how wonderful the world is. To be the new technical world’s witness and enjoy the highly convenient brought from the various types of useful technology. I have a dream, there is one day, my effort can bring the people around me more happiness and convenience. If I can do better, I hope my work can bring more people happiness.</p>
		<p>　  　　Applied Engineering Science, that is what I chose from my career. Unlike tradition undergraduate majors in the College of Engineering. Applied Engineering Science is not a traditional department. Applied Engineering Science reaches across three different colleges for its advanced coursework, The College of Engineering, The Broad College of Business, and the College of Communication Arts and Sciences. 21 century is an era with a huge rapid development in science and technology. In this transformation process, science and technology change is undoubtedly became a lifestyle changes, or even a decisive factor. Applied Engineering Science is the major that I can learn stuffs both from engineering and business. More close to our daily life. Everything can be touched is basic on engineering. Engineering designed them and built them or built some machine to make them. Engineering gives people the most basic life safeguard. Although, business also plays a really important role in our daily life. Money is always the stuff people worried about. Without money people can not order his favourite steak, buy her beautiful high-heeled shoes, or give their kids favourite birthday presents...... Everything come down to money, can be considered as business. Every week we go to the supermarket to buy food, milk, bread, we did business; every month we go to hair cut, we did business; every month we get paid, we also did business. Business has not to be serious big, it is always around us. So, engineering and business are two main characters in our life, and Applied Engineering Science is the combine for these two.</p>
		<p>　  　　Every kid is always full with curiosity. I am one of those kids. When I was a kid, I like to explore everything around me. To touched, to smell, to feel. And wondering how everything works and try them by myself. In the kindergarten, there are lots of different kind of toys. My favourite is building blocks, and I like to build a car, a plane, or a high building. Every time when my grandfather come to pick me up, I always show him what I build. Have to mention that, my grandfather gives me a huge impact in my life. My parents are very busy when i was little, so i always stay with my grandfather. He is really nice guy and he always tell me that people need to help each other and the world will be more beautiful. Every time when we see beggar on the road, he always give me one dollar and let me give to the beggar. I just feel like that is what we are supposed to do, to help people. Until the summer of my 9th grade. That day i just walked to buy breakfast, on the way there is an old lady, her eyes seem not very good and the road is not flat, because the Construction Engineering Brigade is working there. The old lady is moving slowly and worried to step out next step, i saw it just helped her cross the road with my hand and afterwards she gave me smile and said thank you . At that moment I find the most beautiful smile on her face. That smile tells me what I suppose to do for my life. Make more people have the beautiful smile. I back my home, just thinking what can create more happiness to everyone and finally I got the answer. The increasing the better basic material conditions the more people will feel happiness.The basic material conditions covers the basic infrastructure, which refer to the engineering and the business. My father is a business man, he always tell me some about the business and i start to feel like business is not only the way to make money, but also the way to help different compony to manage well. Good business man not only make money and also make every his work partner make money. And the product they made is high quality and people will get benefit from them.  </p>
		<p>　　  　I want to build a building for those homeless people, make them more feeling of home. I want to build a free entertainment park for those pool kids. I want to make the road more flat, let those blind people more easier to walk. I want to make more happiness in this world. All of these is not just one department can accomplish. But, for Applied Engineering Science, I can apply integrated knowledge of engineering and business to real world problems; also apply a systems perspective and modeling competencies in complex situations. I will combine all the resource i have to recalculate and reuse them, to organize every engineering department in a more efficient way. In the business way, i will calculate the mount of money have to spend and list different plan to choose the most suitable plan for the project. Applied Engineering will add value to the company that hires them.</p>
		<p>　　  　In today, the highly technical world, more and more new product come out. The iphone, ipad, labtop. .....All of these are those engineering’s wisdom product. They brought a huge change to the world. But the most important role is the Internet! Basic on the Internet people can use their phone, computer to discover any conner of the world without walk out of their house. Also, work online, communicate to each other online or shopping online. The convenience of the Internet is a huge revolution, it change people’s mind that we can do everything just on the computer. Especially, shopping online, everyone starts shopping online, order food online. Some times when I order stuff on amzon or e-bay. I always feel like the shipping is kind of slow. What if the stuff you order in the morning and it just come this afternoon, that will be so nice. So for my Applied Engineering Science concentrate area, i will choose Supply Chain Management. It just like a huge comprehensive processing center. We receive all the request from everyone and we will try to find the best way you can get that, and we will help you deliver that. Just think about one day you and your family want to have BBQ for dinner, but you find that you do not have any BBQ seasoning, then you just order online, choose the meat you want and all the seasoning you need. We will just find the closet supermarket and get all of your need and deliver to your house. Isn’t that nice? That is also what i want to do for more convenience to people.</p>
		<p>　　  　Overall, Applied Engineering Science is the major I like and also the major the world need. To combine engineering and business, I hope more people can enjoy the convenience and the happiness we bring to the world. Applied Engineering Science graduates make a mark in the world and they make a difference.
