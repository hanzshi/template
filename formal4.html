For every supply chain, customers are always the basic of the supply chain pyramid. The more customers an enterprise has the more business they will have. The base decides how big this chain will be. To manage a supply chain, there are various of resource need to be organized and all of them are considered as customers, and customers are higher than anything. So Compliance to the customers is the base of the framework. Then is continuous improvement. After getting all the resources together, now the supply chain need to do measure and select from those resources to get a better result. Next is the Integration. The combination of all the resources will require a good and detail plan. Integration will make individual resources become more valuable and also make the whole supply chain more effective. Innovation, since there are lots of company doing the same things, innovation become more important. A good ideal can write a bright mark on the product and make a difference to other products. The last is the leadership. A good leader understand how to make the whole team more valuable and will bring the supply chain a different performance. The goal of supply chain is to combine the market, the deliver net, the manufacture process and purchase product together. Make a lower cost and higher service quality to satisfied the clientâ€™s requirement. So the focus point of supply chain management is to use all the resource and related to bring all the member in this chain a bigger profit. </p>
