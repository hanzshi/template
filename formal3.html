			<h1>Background Information</h1>
			<p>In Ananth’s scholarly journal, “Development of a Framework for Supply Chain Research in Industrial Engineering.” He claims that Supply Chain Management is a very popular area of research and has spawned a large number of research efforts and publications. From Ananth’s perspective SCM has became an essential role of the industrial engineering. And developing a framework will bring together different perspectives on SCM and provides an all round view of the field. Where are the advantage of supply chain management come from? These are not some new concepts. As from people built the pyramid or relief for victims in Africa, people are always doing the principle of “To satisfied the client’s requirement by enhance the effective flow between real objects and information.” And this principle has never been changed. As recently, some business organization starts realizing that supply chain management can bring them huge advantage in the competition. For the entire framework, this principle has became the backbone of this system. In this framework, a new way from supply chain engineering viewpoint to classify and categorize supply chain problems has been brought in. That will help increase the rate of assimilation of existing and new research in the area of Supply Chain Management and promote the discipline of Supply Chain Engineering.
   From the trade Journal “NewsRX”, there is an article about Intel Corporation, “Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals; Intel Corporation Receives Top Supply Chain Award at CSCMP Conference.” It talked about that Intel Corporation received first place in the 2009 Supply Chain Innovation Award competition at the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals’ annual global conference held in Chicago. Why Intel can be chosen as the first place? Firstly, Intel’s multiple years initiative to significantly improve customer satisfaction via increased response and delivery performance. “Just Say Yes!” That is the key of Intel can receive the Award. No matter what kinds of feedback they receive from the customers Intel will just say Yes! They will receive the problems and try to find this problem from themselves and slove it and give the customer the best response. There is once a brutal guy name Jack brought a computer with Intel’s CPU. One day he left his son in the house and his son accidentality pulled coke on the host machine, but he is afraid that his father will hit him so he did not tell his father. When Jack back home and log on his computer, he found that the computer become really slow and the graphic become blurry. He asked his son did he do anything on the computer but his son said he just cleat the computer did not do  anything . He feel mad about the computer, so the next he took the computer to the Intel corporation. He set the computer on the front desk and yelled really loud with some bad words. The greeter faced that but did not say anything, just said “Yes, sir we will fix it!” and take the computer to the salvage depot. After about 15mins the greeter take the computer back and talk to Jack with simile : “Sir, we fixed it. But pull water to the host machine is not a good way to clear the computer.” Jack realized that may cause by his son. He feels bad about his attitude and at the same time he feels Intel has a really good attitude to everything. “Just Say Yes” resulted in more than a 40 percent improvement in customer feedback scores, supported by a 300 percent-plus improvement in change order responsiveness, in addition to achieving best-in-class levels of delivery performance. “To satisfied the client’s requirement by enhance the effective flow between real objects and information.” This is always the principle of Supply Chain. “Just say Yes!” is also a good express of this principle.</p>
