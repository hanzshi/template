                <p> The target of the group of people in the video is to protect the world of world of warcraft. A guy who play the world of warcraft a lot and he reaches a unbelievable level and he starts to killing every single characters in the game. That really make all of world of warcraft players loss their patient on the game by keeping be killed by that bad guy. Same as the group four people. At first they always get killed when they logged in game. But they have discussed and decided to level up secrectly. Finally they rech a really high level and be able to fight against that bad guy. Finally they get the power by the sword of thousands truth from the Blizzard and defeat the bad guy. Bring back the peace and harmony to the world of warcraft. From my perspective, i think the social issue is that we need to group up and to defeat the hard challenges. Just like in World of Warcraft, people have to group up and to defeat the bad guy, to matian the justice. Its same as our real life, people should work together, learn from each other, help each other. Everyone has his own job and have to be responsible for that in order to win the battle. Just as the real world, it is consists of a lot of different parts. And everyoneâ€™s job will be one of those little part. People need to focus on his work and do better at his work, to make himself valuable and make contribution to the whole team which is the world. Teamwork is very important in our daily real life. Work together, the world will have a more beautiful future!</p>
