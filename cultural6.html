			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p>I am now just a student, my job now is to learn enough knowledge to get ready for the challenges I will face when I step on my real job. All the students just like the armyâ€™s reserve. We are getting training while we studying. But there is always one day we will become the main strength of an army and fight at the frontline for the world. Work or study as a team is also very important for a student. It is really hard to be hundred percent focus on the class and understand all the material the teacher said. So after class group study is a good way for everyone to exchange their knowledge and experience. We can always learn different things from others, and other can also learn from you. By discuss the problem or question the problem, everyone can get a deep understand of the material. And usually when group work we can remember things more firmly in the mind, because the problem people always ask will be repeat several times and that can enhance our memorization to that problem. Also teamwork will be more efficient than individual study. Group study can force everyone pay attention to the question, it gives a good study environment and individual is really easy to be disturbed by other things. As a student, I need to learn as much knowledge as I can, in order to take charge the heavy responsibility the world will give you. Also, experience is very important, I need to find some opportunities to get internship. That is the most effective way to make yourself fit into society, get ready for the battlefront. </p>
