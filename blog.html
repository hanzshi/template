                <h1>blog entry 1</h1>
                <p>From the video, the man told a story. He described his own situation by start with a peom. The man was 
                a guy and his families think that is really bad and even want he shoot himself. I feel like that is really 
                bad. Everyone have the right to love someone and love is beautiful. No matter who you are and who you love. Love is from the
                deep of the heart and is the natural reaction of any person of the world. Love bring the warm and can save
                a people from the heart. There is always someone in the world who love you and will encourage you. God created
                the people and everyone is equally. So there is no reason for people to look down those gay people and treat
                them bad. From my perspective, gay is just people find the true love is the same sexual. Everyone will have a right person
                in his life and they both the soulmate to each other. No matter he is a man or woman. People need to be respect
                to everyone, and do not look down on those people. Everyone should be the same and treated the same way. Everyone have
                his own right to choose what he like and what he want. People are equaility to each other and we should be respect to everyone 
                that is also show the respect to the God. </p>
