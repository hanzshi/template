                <p>From the video, the man told a story. He described his own situation by start with a peom. The man was 
                a guy and his families think that is really bad and even want he shoot himself. I feel like that is really 
                bad. Everyone have the right to love someone and love is beautiful. No matter who you are and who you love. Love is from the
                deep of the heart and is the natural reaction of any person of the world. Love bring the warm and can save
                a people from the heart. There is always someone in the world who love you and will encourage you. God created
                the people and everyone is equally. So there is no reason for people to look down those gay people and treat
                them bad. From my perspective, gay is just people find the true love is the same sexual. Everyone will have a right person
                in his life and they both the soulmate to each other. No matter he is a man or woman. People need to be respect
                to everyone, and do not look down on those people. Everyone should be the same and treated the same way. Everyone have
                his own right to choose what he like and what he want. People are equaility to each other and we should be respect to everyone 
                that is also show the respect to the God. </p>

                <p> The target of the group of people in the video is to protect the world of world of warcraft. A guy who play the world of warcraft a lot and he reaches a unbelievable level and he starts to killing every single characters in the game. That really make all of world of warcraft players loss their patient on the game by keeping be killed by that bad guy. Same as the group four people. At first they always get killed when they logged in game. But they have discussed and decided to level up secrectly. Finally they rech a really high level and be able to fight against that bad guy. Finally they get the power by the sword of thousands truth from the Blizzard and defeat the bad guy. Bring back the peace and harmony to the world of warcraft. From my perspective, i think the social issue is that we need to group up and to defeat the hard challenges. Just like in World of Warcraft, people have to group up and to defeat the bad guy, to matian the justice. Its same as our real life, people should work together, learn from each other, help each other. Everyone has his own job and have to be responsible for that in order to win the battle. Just as the real world, it is consists of a lot of different parts. And everyone’s job will be one of those little part. People need to focus on his work and do better at his work, to make himself valuable and make contribution to the whole team which is the world. Teamwork is very important in our daily real life. Work together, the world will have a more beautiful future!</p>

                <p>This advertisement is not only an ad, it is very powerful.Detroit, is described as a hard working city. A city made by hot steels, by people's sweat. Detroit is an iron city, powerful, and with passion. In this Advertisement, Detroit is the answer of the question. Responsebility to everything and represent a beautiful America. The Voice of the Voiceover is kind of deep, it represents the iron of Detorit city. The voice gives the audience a kind of powerful feeling, just like a sleepy lion waked up and will face all the challenges.‘Imported from Detroit’ brought the swagger back to the American car industry and the city of Detroit in particular, it is less about the product and more about the brand, the industry, and the city of Detroit. When audience see such an advertisement, and buy the Chrysler's car. Not only a car they brought but also a trust to the city Detroit is brought from their heart. It is a powerfull advertisement, not only the product, Chrysler, but also the background of city and the background music, make people feel steady and trustable. Good Advertisement!  </p>

                <p>The first project we need to do is Lived Experience Project. From my perspective, I feel like everyone in this world is the lucky man, cause they have the chance to see how wonderful the world is. To be the new technical world’s witness and enjoy the highly convenient brought from the various types of useful technology. I have a dream, there is one day, my effort can bring the people around me more happiness and convenience. If I can do better, I hope my work can bring more people happiness. I have chose my major as Applied Engineering Science, and I like my major.Unlike tradition undergraduate majors in the College of Engineering. Applied Engineering Science is not a traditional department. Applied Engineering Science reaches across three different colleges for its advanced coursework, The College of Engineering, The Broad College of Business, and the College of Communication Arts and Sciences. So Applied Engineering Science is a major combine three different majors, which I personal feel is very suitable for me and I will fight for it!</p>

                <p>We are keep working on our Lived Experience Project. I did some research about my topic, which is Applied Engineering Science and I found out that, in today, the highly technical world, more and more new product come out. The iphone, ipad, labtop. .....All of these are those engineering’s wisdom product. They brought a huge change to the world. But the most important role is the Internet! Basic on the Internet people can use their phone, computer to discover any conner of the world without walk out of their house. Also, work online, communicate to each other online or shopping online. The convenience of the Internet is a huge revolution, it change people’s mind that we can do everything just on the computer. Especially, shopping online, everyone starts shopping online, order food online. Some times when I order stuff on amzon or e-bay. I always feel like the shipping is kind of slow. What if the stuff you order in the morning and it just come this afternoon, that will be so nice. All of these I found out let me step on a new height to view the technology world.</p>

                <p>We have moved on to our second project, Cultural Analysis Project. The first thing get into my mind is that there are various kind of Heroic games and movies, and they are very popular among the people. As a result, lots of people would act just like the hero in the video games or the movies, try to do everything by themself. However, from my perspective, single hero will never stronger than a team. So, I contended that people should unite together, learn from each other, and combine everyone’s different resources together, doing teamwork. Overall, teamwork is more efficient than any other single work and it will create a beautiful new future for people. I am an engineering student, so I have a lot of experience of teamwork. For an engineering project, teamwork is very important, everyone need to participaint into it and use their advantage and then will have a good result. So, I decided that my cultural analysis will analysis the important of team work in our daily life..</p>

                <p>We are still working on the Cultural Analysis Project. To do this project students will select an artifact of popular culture and depicts social issue. I was playing World of Warcraft when this project came. So I picked World of Warcraft as my popular culture. I love World of Warcraft so I have a lot of experience of this game and also from this game I can see reflected lots of social issues. After experiencing the first project I have the sense to write the paper. Basic follow the guideline provided as my structure of my paper, using personal thinking and critical analysis the social issues. I thought a lot about the game reflects to the Society and the most is the teamwork. No matter in the game or in the real world, teamwork is always play an important in people's daliy life. So, World of Warcraft and teamwork, prefect for cultural analysis.</p>

                <p>The third project is the formal research project. I am considering about doing research on Science affect the world. Because there are many wonders of science. Science plays an important part in our daily life. It has made our life easier and more comfortable. Science is nothing but a systematic way of knowledge and living. Man’s qualities of curiously, alertness and keen observation of changes in natural happenings has given birth to science and scientific study. Scientists have invented several things and machine – big and small – through observation of very simple events. Water boiling in a kettle has given us the idea of Railway engine. Falling of apple from a tree has helped Newton to discover the law of gravity. Electricity is the greatest invention of man. It serves us in hundreds and thousands of ways. It runs our trains, mills and factories. It cools and keeps our houses warm. It washes and irons our clothes. It gives us cool air and entertains us through Cinema, TV and radio, besides lighting our houses. But also, I am thinking linking science to my major and daily life. So I think about supply chain management. This is my concertration will be and this links to people's daily life very close. So I did some research about supply chain. Supply Chain Management is a system of organizations, people, activities, information, and resources involved in moving a product or service from supplier to customer. The one who integrate all the resource together and make the best combination to other for their product. So, I will do research on Science and Supply Chain management.</p>

                <p>I keep doing research on Supply Chain, and I have learned a lot from the research information I got. Supply Chain Management is an essential element to operational efficiency. Supply Chain Management can be applied to customer satisfaction and company success, it can also help improve quality of life. Basically, the world is a huge supply chain. Supply Chain Management is a system of organizations, people, activities, information, and resources involved in moving a product or service from supplier to customer. The one who integrate all the resource together and make the best combination to other for their product. Supply Chain Management is globally. Most of good companies will require different parts of their product from different place of the world, since the quality and the price. Communication is important for Supply Chain Management. When they are organizing all the resource they will have to communicate to other companies or others. That will take Supply Chain Management do a series of research to get all the information of the target. Usually, the information can be found online, but sometimes in order to get a more detail information face to face meet is necessary. For Supply Chain Management, all kinds of technology will be used in order to get their resource. They will need communication technology such as, Internet resource and people relation to integral their resource. And then the basic transportation such as, fly, boat, train, to deliver their resource to those company which need it. If there is no this project I will not know all of this, this project force me do all the research and now I have a well understanding of Supply Chain.</p>

                <p>Now, here comes the fourth project, the Remix Project. This Multimedia Remix Project is going to show the effects of the highly technology will bring to people’s life especial the current generation. Our idea is coming from Jenna’s Cultural analysis paper. In nowadays the technology is developing rapidly, and everyone everyday have to face various of technology. As a result the technology has became overloaded. So our documentary is going to propose that the current generation should use less and less technology.Our team has a group chat which we can keep contact with each other while someone of us find some good resource and shared on the D2L working area, others can check the resources and give suggestions. In order to finish this project our group has meet up twice in the main library. We discussed how our video’s structure suppose to be and what kind of video link or pictures we supposed to use in our documentary. I personally did some research about the technology affect the society and found some links with good YouTube videos our team can get idea from, and also along with these links, i put my opinions with them.</p>

                <p>In this semester, I have 5 classes. And each one of them is fun for me. First I wanna make an conclusion for my EGR 100 class. This class is my easiest class. It's every Friday morning schedule. Usually I can sleep till noon and get up, but in order to take this class every friday I will need to get up earlier. This class is an interesting, Engineering design process as modeled by team-based, interdisciplinary design projects. Roles of engineers and the contributions of engineering in society. Project management, and design of products and processes to specified outcomes under specified constraints. Introduction to computing tools and physical equipment in support of engineering design. Engineering ethics. Oral and written technical communications. In this class I have make two projects and both of them did a good job. My favourit is the second project and also the one I put lots of effort. Fot this project my team needs to make an app on android phone. And our team made a Spartan mini golf game, which is pretty fun. I am the one who made the whole game, so I have lots of special experience of this project. When a challenge came in front of me, I have to face it, be responsible to the whole team. If I didn't fix the challenge the whole team will get points off. And also the teamwork is important for engineering students. Everyone has his own advantages and needs to bring it in and the project can be finish as the best result! A good and fun class.</p>

                <p>Another egr class I am taking this semester is EGR 102. This class is way different than EGR 100. This course is basic teaching about Application of systematic approaches to engineering problems. Problem decomposition and identification of a solution approach. Solution using tools such as advanced spreadsheet features and MATLAB. Data representation, curve fitting and analysis. Mathematical modeling of engineering systems. Application of principles through team-based engineering projects. So every class we need use computer to finish the tasks. At the first period of our egr 102 class. We have learned about how to use excel. However I have used excel before, but this is different. We are learning how to use excel to solve the equation and use excel to goal seek. A series advantage skill have been taught. Also, after teaching the excel We have learned Matlab. Which is a very good code program. This is my first time touch coding program and I am very interesting about that. We learned how to use script to solve problems and how to use function to get outputs. At the end of this class. We are required to make a big Matlab project to find the best pump for a Lift station. I used 6 classes period finially finish the coding. This brought me lots of engineering experience and I love it.</p>

                <p>Math 234 class I took this year is quite fun. I go to class every single class and treat this class as my best. The professor for this class is a very good teacher. Mr. schmit. He is a nice guy. He is good at time control and when the material gets boring he will give us a joke to make the class more joyful. MTH 234 is also called Calculous 3, Vectors in space. Functions of several variables and partial differentiation. Multiple integrals. Line and surface integrals. Green's and Stokes's theorems. All of these are good challenges to students. We have to open our mind and put effort into it to get a good grade. Every Tuesday we have recitation, this is the small section and TA will give us a Quiz to test our knowledge according to the previous week. Overall we took four tests each covers different materials. Mr.schmit gave us a really good review on the last day of test, so I did a good job on every of my test. I put effort into this class and it gave me a good grade. I think I will have a 4.0 for this class and this class is the one I feel the most organized and ordered class I have took this semster. Lots of people hate math, but acutually math is not a hard class, people just need put effort into it. And it will give back the same result as much effort as you put in. So, I think this is a fair class and good class to practive our logical and preciseness.</p>

                <p>My favourite class is my weight traning class. This class has brought me too much. This a Basic level weight training principles, basic anatomy, and diet and nutrition. Enhance muscular strength, endurance and flexibility. Because of all of this basic skills this class taught me, I start love working out. Right I will go to gym at least 4 times a week jut to do some weight lifting. I feel like I become stronger after taking this class. The instrctor Justin, he is a really nice guy and he is willing to help me correct my position. I really apperaite about that. And he requires all of us to record our training stuffs. At the end of semester, when I look back the record I notice that I have improve a lot in this class. I learned how to force myself in this class. When you doing bench press untill exhausted you need to tell yourself you can do it and do one more press. That is how I get stronger. And also other students and Justin they cheer up for me and that gives me more power. Also, In this class I learnd never give up. Sometimes when I do some extra heavy weights I will have the feeling that I can not do it. At this time Justin tell us we need keep going just to do one set will be different. When you lift that one extra heavy weight, you will feel great and may be able to finish a second one. Do not be lazy, that is also I learned in this class. Sometime people will become lazy and do not want to do anything. At this time, people need to force themselves to move, to stand up, to step up his own comfort zone. When you step out your comfort zone, that is the time you get improve. Best class!</p>

                <p>The last class I took this semester is WRA110 which is this class. This is a great class and also the class I have learned the most! WRA 110 is the study and practice of varieties of invention, arrangement, revision, style and delivery to help students make successful transitions to writing, reading and researching in higher education. In order to have a better skill of successful life or career, good writing, reading and researching abilities is the essential. This course is where students can learn those necessary abilities and get the knowledge to using them in life. In this course I have experienced lots of interesting projects this semester, including Lived Experienced Project, Cultural Analysis Proposal, Formal Research Project, Multimedia Remix Project, Blogs and this one is working on Course Retrospective Project. All of these are good experience for me, and the way I was doing these is also the way I am building myself. This course is a challenge for me, whose first language is not english. As soon as I finished projects one by one, the more reading, writing, analysis skills I gathered from this course. Still, it is hard for me to write a 3000 words length paper. But the writing logic and researching skills I had now, is enough for me to face these challenge. The more challenge I faced the more improvement I will have. Also the coding skill I learned from this class is very good. If there is no this class I will never touch Html and get chance to learn these interesting coding skills. When I lood at the website I created I feel really satisfied. Good class!</p>

                <p>I am now just a student, my job now is to learn enough knowledge to get ready for the challenges I will face when I step on my real job. All the students just like the army’s reserve. We are getting training while we studying. But there is always one day we will become the main strength of an army and fight at the frontline for the world. Work or study as a team is also very important for a student. It is really hard to be hundred percent focus on the class and understand all the material the teacher said. So after class group study is a good way for everyone to exchange their knowledge and experience. We can always learn different things from others, and other can also learn from you. By discuss the problem or question the problem, everyone can get a deep understand of the material. And usually when group work we can remember things more firmly in the mind, because the problem people always ask will be repeat several times and that can enhance our memorization to that problem. Also teamwork will be more efficient than individual study. Group study can force everyone pay attention to the question, it gives a good study environment and individual is really easy to be disturbed by other things. As a student, I need to learn as much knowledge as I can, in order to take charge the heavy responsibility the world will give you. </p>
