                <p>From the video, the man told a story. He described his own situation by start with a peom. The man was 
                a guy and his families think that is really bad and even want he shoot himself. I feel like that is really 
                bad. Everyone have the right to love someone and love is beautiful. No matter who you are and who you love. Love is from the
                deep of the heart and is the natural reaction of any person of the world. Love bring the warm and can save
                a people from the heart. There is always someone in the world who love you and will encourage you. God created
                the people and everyone is equally. So there is no reason for people to look down those gay people and treat
                them bad. From my perspective, gay is just people find the true love is the same sexual. Everyone will have a right person
                in his life and they both the soulmate to each other. No matter he is a man or woman. People need to be respect
                to everyone, and do not look down on those people. Everyone should be the same and treated the same way. Everyone have
                his own right to choose what he like and what he want. People are equaility to each other and we should be respect to everyone 
                that is also show the respect to the God. </p>

                <p> The target of the group of people in the video is to protect the world of world of warcraft. A guy who play the world of warcraft a lot and he reaches a unbelievable level and he starts to killing every single characters in the game. That really make all of world of warcraft players loss their patient on the game by keeping be killed by that bad guy. Same as the group four people. At first they always get killed when they logged in game. But they have discussed and decided to level up secrectly. Finally they rech a really high level and be able to fight against that bad guy. Finally they get the power by the sword of thousands truth from the Blizzard and defeat the bad guy. Bring back the peace and harmony to the world of warcraft. From my perspective, i think the social issue is that we need to group up and to defeat the hard challenges. Just like in World of Warcraft, people have to group up and to defeat the bad guy, to matian the justice. Its same as our real life, people should work together, learn from each other, help each other. Everyone has his own job and have to be responsible for that in order to win the battle. Just as the real world, it is consists of a lot of different parts. And everyone’s job will be one of those little part. People need to focus on his work and do better at his work, to make himself valuable and make contribution to the whole team which is the world. Teamwork is very important in our daily real life. Work together, the world will have a more beautiful future!</p>

                <p>This advertisement is not only an ad, it is very powerful.Detroit, is described as a hard working city. A city made by hot steels, by people's sweat. Detroit is an iron city, powerful, and with passion. In this Advertisement, Detroit is the answer of the question. Responsebility to everything and represent a beautiful America. The Voice of the Voiceover is kind of deep, it represents the iron of Detorit city. The voice gives the audience a kind of powerful feeling, just like a sleepy lion waked up and will face all the challenges.‘Imported from Detroit’ brought the swagger back to the American car industry and the city of Detroit in particular, it is less about the product and more about the brand, the industry, and the city of Detroit. When audience see such an advertisement, and buy the Chrysler's car. Not only a car they brought but also a trust to the city Detroit is brought from their heart. It is a powerfull advertisement, not only the product, Chrysler, but also the background of city and the background music, make people feel steady and trustable. Good Advertisement!  </p>

                <p>Everyone in this world is the lucky man, cause they have the chance to see how wonderful the world is. To be the new technical world’s witness and enjoy the highly convenient brought from the various types of useful technology. I have a dream, there is one day, my effort can bring the people around me more happiness and convenience. If I can do better, I hope my work can bring more people happiness. I have chose my major as Applied Engineering Science, and I like my major.Unlike tradition undergraduate majors in the College of Engineering. Applied Engineering Science is not a traditional department. Applied Engineering Science reaches across three different colleges for its advanced coursework, The College of Engineering, The Broad College of Business, and the College of Communication Arts and Sciences. So Applied Engineering Science is a major combine three different majors, which I personal feel is very suitable for me and I will fight for it!</p>

                <p>In today, the highly technical world, more and more new product come out. The iphone, ipad, labtop. .....All of these are those engineering’s wisdom product. They brought a huge change to the world. But the most important role is the Internet! Basic on the Internet people can use their phone, computer to discover any conner of the world without walk out of their house. Also, work online, communicate to each other online or shopping online. The convenience of the Internet is a huge revolution, it change people’s mind that we can do everything just on the computer. Especially, shopping online, everyone starts shopping online, order food online. Some times when I order stuff on amzon or e-bay. I always feel like the shipping is kind of slow. What if the stuff you order in the morning and it just come this afternoon, that will be so nice. </p>

                <p>Nowadays, there are various kind of Heroic games and movies, and they are very popular among the people. As a result, lots of people would act just like the hero in the video games or the movies, try to do everything by themself. However, from my perspective, single hero will never stronger than a team. So, I contended that people should unite together, learn from each other, and combine everyone’s different resources together, doing teamwork. Overall, teamwork is more efficient than any other single work and it will create a beautiful new future for people. I am an engineering student, so I have a lot of experience of teamwork. For an engineering project, teamwork is very important, everyone need to participaint into it and use their advantage and then will have a good result. So, work as a team, that will help you a lot.</p>

                <p>There are many wonders of science. Science plays an important part in our daily life. It has made our life easier and more comfortable. Science is nothing but a systematic way of knowledge and living. Man’s qualities of curiously, alertness and keen observation of changes in natural happenings has given birth to science and scientific study. Scientists have invented several things and machine – big and small – through observation of very simple events. Water boiling in a kettle has given us the idea of Railway engine. Falling of apple from a tree has helped Newton to discover the law of gravity. Electricity is the greatest invention of man. It serves us in hundreds and thousands of ways. It runs our trains, mills and factories. It cools and keeps our houses warm. It washes and irons our clothes. It gives us cool air and entertains us through Cinema, TV and radio, besides lighting our houses. Modern life is impossible without electricity.</p>
