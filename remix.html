		<h1>Remix Memo</h1>
		<p>This Multimedia Remix Project is going to show the effects of the highly technology will bring to people’s life especial the current generation. Our idea is coming from Jenna’s Cultural analysis paper. In nowadays the technology is developing rapidly, and everyone everyday have to face various of technology. As a result the technology has became overloaded. So our documentary is going to propose that the current generation should use less and less technology. </p>
		<p>Our team has a group chat which we can keep contact with each other while someone of us find some good resource and shared on the D2L working area, others can check the resources and give suggestions. In order to finish this project our group has meet up twice in the main library. We discussed how our video’s structure suppose to be and what kind of video link or pictures we supposed to use in our documentary. I personally did some research about the technology affect the society and found some links with good YouTube videos our team can get idea from, and also along with these links, i put my opinions with them. And here is my research work: </p>

		<p>This is a 7 mins video. We can make similar video as this one. Basic using lots of pictures and someone talk along with the pictures, just like telling a story. In 1:05~2:26, there is a short cartoon we may can use for the effects about technology to people. And under the video, there are lots of good comments about the issues, we can probably use for those words we can say in the video.</p>

		<p>This is about one and half mins video, its a good one. We can do the same things. Just add some more stuffs such as, put some short videos and our interviews across the pictures. </p>

		<p>This video is about 6 and half mins. The video stars talking about the bad effects of technology on children at 55s. There are lots of information covered but it is just about the effect to kids. Still we can pull out some of points to put in our video.</p>
		<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbVKPhVCRFI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbVKPhVCRFI</a></li>
		<p>This is a 4 and half mins video. Starts at 1:05, it starts talking about how technology will bring positive effect to students.</p>
		</ol>
		<p>There are lots of video online, we can find tons of resource. I feel like to make this project easy. We can just find some pictures about the technology related to people’s life. Edite them together with some slides with words on it. Such as, one pic, one word slide, or some pics, one word slides. Also, to make the video long enough , we can put a short video into it to make it more interesting. And also the interview parts will be the biggest part of our documentary. 
That is my opinion, any suggestion?</p>

		<p>Also, the main part of the documentary is the interview. Each one of us take a few interviews and we edited them together. Our group comes up some interview questions and posted on D2L, so we will have the same interview questions. I interviewed my friend on my floor, Dylan and our floor’s RA Jacob. Both of them did a good job on the interview. When we edited the documentary, some parts we need to record our sound with it. After we record the sound and we go over the video. I don’t like my english. I feel like my pronounce of english still need more practice.</p>
		<p>Overall, I person feel this is a good group and we did a good job of this project. Jenna, she did the most work, she edited the documentary and the interview. Since she has never done the same things before, the work she did is very good and fast. Jordan, she always has some good ideals and will tell some interesting stories during the free time. Emily, she is pretty and smart. She thinks questions really fast and talks fast, always can set up a good position to the problems. This is an interesting project and this my first time did a project like this. This project can bring us more close to the society and gather social experience by ourselves. Like this Project. Here is the link to our documentary:</p>
