			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>The same as real world, everything is consists of a lot of different parts. And everyone’s job will be one of those little part. In order to get a more comfortable life, people have to work. How much work people put into his job will pay back by the money he received. If everyone in the team is able to work really hard, then this will be a high valuable team and lots of company or customer will be willing to collaborate with them. As a result, the money they make will be much more than others. That is a good teamwork’s advantage, which will bring to every team members. People need to focus on his work and do better at his work, to make himself valuable and make contribution to the whole team which is the world. Teamwork is very important in our daily real life. Such as my EGR 100 class. In our class, we need to design different project basic with different group of four people. Our first project is to create a unique robot by simulate the design, construction, programming and testing of a vehicle used to locate, lift and carry a load through a factory to a prescribed location. In our team, everyone have to thinking, and to design the robot. We combined everyone’s different ideals and finally make our robot based on the shape of a forklift with a big shovel in the front of it. And when we test the robot, there are always someone recording the data and situation we have met and another person to observe the route of the robot and we can calculate the best route for the robot. This is a team project, we are doing this project by the strength of all four of us. We meet in the evening only twice and we finish the project and get it work at the first and spend the shortest time, get the first place in the robot competition. Teamwork make us more efficiently and it is the key for us to win the competition. In some situation, there may be some teams can be a tendency for members to sit back and let others do most of the work. It will make people feel he is doing extra work and feel like unbalanced because of the unequal participation. Also some workers may not function well as part of a team. Would rather to work on their own. If put these people to a team, that will make them feel uncomfortable and will waste the resources. Some people may appear to be team players fellow team members, or to curry favor with the team leader for their own benefit. As all have mentioned, there are some disadvantage to the teamwork. Same in World of Warcraft, there will always someone not listen to the command, not doing his job and make the team be defeated by the boss. So there are some people is not suitable for team work. And it is better to let those people work individually or kick out from the team. Those people will affect the team’s positive environment and show the bad behave in the team which will ruin the team’s environment. </p>
