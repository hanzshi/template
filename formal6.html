			<p>　　　The competitive advantages, connected with the growth of globalization and innovations, begin to lose gradually their originality, and new competitive advantages come up in front-flexibility, order-to-delivery lead-time reductions, reliable and quality deliveries, and choice opportunities. The ability of manufacturers to join the individual consumer preferences together with their production process and system of planning will be a decisive factor in the field of competition. The solution of the problem with individual client orders is possible only by setting up of a flexible system of production management.
　　　Firstly, it will require the implementation of new and up-to-date concepts of production management like CFM (Customer Focused Manufacturing), SCM (Supply Chain Management) and technologies, based on the same concepts as ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), CRM (Customer Relationship Management), etc. It will also require supply handling, synchronized with production and effective distribution based on the interaction of logistics intermediaries.
   Secondly, it is necessary to optimize the transportation system both at a micro- and macro-level. The complex development of transport infrastructure is based on the standardization of goods and freight, means of transportation, mechanisms of handling cargo, delivery speed, widening of road and railway networks, improvement of service maintenance.
   Thirdly, the information exchange plays an increasing part. Industrial companies have to interact in the field of information so that information can be accessed in the right form, at the right time, by the right authorities and in authentic type, protected from unauthorized use. 
   A supply chain consists of all parties involved, directly or indirectly, in fulfilling a customer request. Within each organization, the supply chain includes all functions involved in receiving and filling a customer request. The functions include but are not limited to, new product development, marketing ,operations, distribution, finance, and customer service. A supply chain is dynamic and involves the constant flow of information, product, and funds between different stages. These stages may be defined as Customers, Retailers, Logistics, Supplier, Distributor and Manufacturer. Each stage in a supply chain is connected through the flow of products, information, and funds. These flows of occur in both directions and may be managed by one of the stages or an intermediary. The objective of every supply chain should be to maximize the overall value generated. The value a supply chain generates is the difference between what the final product is worth to the customer and costs the supply chain incurs in filling the customer’s request. For most commercial supply chains, value will be strongly correlated with supply chain surplus.</p>
